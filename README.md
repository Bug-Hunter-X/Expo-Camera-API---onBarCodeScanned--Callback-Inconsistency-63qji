# Expo Camera API: `onBarCodeScanned` Callback Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where the `onBarCodeScanned` callback function is not always triggered reliably when barcodes are scanned.  The problem leads to unpredictable behavior and makes the barcode scanning functionality unreliable. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic implementation.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the issue by implementing more robust barcode detection logic and error handling.

## Bug Report

The main issue is the intermittent failure of the `onBarCodeScanned` function to fire.  This happens even under ideal conditions, where a barcode is clearly within the camera's view and the scanning process should function correctly. Possible reasons for this behavior include race conditions or asynchronous operations within the Expo Camera API that are not properly handled. The solution below presents a method to mitigate the issue.

## Solution

The proposed solution implements an improved method of barcode scanning involving checking for the scanned barcode data using a timeout mechanism. This increases the chance of capturing the data even if the callback is delayed or fails to fire immediately.  This should improve the reliability of the barcode scanning function.
