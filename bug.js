This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The issue is that the `onBarCodeScanned` callback is not triggered consistently, and sometimes it completely fails to fire even when a barcode is clearly detected. This leads to an unpredictable user experience because barcode scanning functionality becomes unreliable.  The problem seems to be related to the interaction between the camera's scanning logic and the custom function, possibly due to a race condition or unexpected behavior in the Expo library itself.
